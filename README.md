# Project Portfolio
## Description of the project:
The purpose of this website is to showcase a number of project done during the Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN

## Roadmap of future improvements:
Add different routes and give the user the ability to select from a list of routes.
I would also like to add routes for other cities that have a public API sharing this type of data.
